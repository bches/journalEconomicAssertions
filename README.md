# The Journal of Economic Assertions

## NOTE: This project is under construction and is not yet functional

The Journal of Economic Assertions (JEA) is a fully-automatic bookkeeping system that 
allows entities to assert economic transactions by sending digitally-signed messages to 
an independent bookkeeper that records the transaction according to generally-accepted 
accounting principles.  Assertion messages can be made from any software, although a 
python implementation of the messaging client is provided.  Both the client and the 
server are open source, available in python. The JEA is also able to provide each of the 
four major financial reports: income statement, balance sheet, statement of 
shareholdersâ€™ equity and the statement of cash flows, as well as generate other reports 
and analysis.  Examples are given and the accounting basis of all transactions is open 
for inspection.  With the JEA it is possible to issue equity, issue debt, and exchange 
payment without having to do the bookkeeping yourself.
